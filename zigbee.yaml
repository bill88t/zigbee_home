general:
  # Defines how much time a loop will sleep after each iteration.
  # Note: This does not necesseraly mean that each 2 minutes
  # sensor values will be updated. Currently all sensors are polled
  # synchronously, which means that if there are 3 sensors defined
  # and each needs 5 seconds to obtain the result then it will take
  # (3 * 5)s + runevery, which in this case will be 1m15s.
  runevery: 1m

  # Defines specific major & minor version that should be used.
  # Later patch version can be automatically selected by the program, 
  # if specific version is not found. 
  # I.e. if requested v2.7.0, but only v2.7.2 is found - v2.7.2 will be used instead.
  # Higher then minimum supported version can be specified (but may be incompatible),
  # but lower then minimum version will result in an error.
  # This is optional configuration.

# This section is for defining peripherals

# NOTE: Only changes should be defined here.
# See https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/main/boards/<vendor>/<board_name>/<board_name>.dts

board:

  # This field is optional, and in most cases this might not be needed.
  # But it is possible that board can be flashed
  # with some non-default bootloader, or that the generated firmware is not
  # placed correctly in memory. This setting can help in above situations.
  # Also this option can be used to try and support boards that
  # are not labeled as officialy supported.

  # Note: if this field is present - this will force bootloader
  # to be selected one, even if the value is empty string.
